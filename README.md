Make a digital, analog Clock using javascript &amp; css style
Description

This digital clock application uses HTML to structure the page, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to provide the clock functionality. Here's an overview of each file:

HTML File (index.html): This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page. It includes references to the CSS file (clock.css) and the JavaScript file (clock.js). It also contains a <div> element with a class of frame that holds the digital clock.
CSS File (clock.css): This file contains the styles for the digital clock and the overall appearance of the web page. It includes a font import, defines some custom CSS variables, and sets styles for various elements.
JavaScript File (clock.js): This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for updating and displaying the current time on the digital clock. It uses the Date object to get the current time and manipulates the hours, minutes, and seconds to display them in the format HH:MM:SS AM/PM. The runClock function is called initially to set the clock, and then setInterval ensures it updates every second.
Running the Program

To run this digital clock program, save the respective files with the given names (index.html, clock.css, and clock.js) in the same directory. Open index.html in a web browser, and you should see the digital clock displayed on the page.

Feel free to customize the styles, fonts, or add additional features as per your requirements. Enjoy your digital clock!
